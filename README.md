## So what is this project/game, and why did i make it?

## Possible further development on it
- Introduce difficulties like : Easy, Medium, Hard
- Introduce more ways to input answer like an input field, rather than only having 4 option answer field.
- Categorise the elements into their room temp state, : Solid, Liquid, Gas, etc.
- Add isotopes
